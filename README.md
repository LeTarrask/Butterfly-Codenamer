Odebretchr
===================

Odebretchr is a stupid political joke about Brazilian politicians and the nicknames used to hide corrupt actions. Most corrupt politicians had funny nicknames in the corrupt companies accounting systems, so we made this tool to help readers know who is who.

It replaces politics’ names with their outlaw nicknames from the infamous "Planilha Odebrecht".

We recommend reading the wiki for <a href="http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Car_Wash">Operação Lava Jato</a> for double laughs.

To install

Odebretchr is almost entirely cloned from Lauren Orsini’s <a href="https://github.com/laurenorsini/caaaaarbs">Caaaaarbs</a>, which is is a stupid joke Chrome extension about her editor, Owen Thomas, who follows the Paleo diet. 

Caaaaarbs is nearly 100% cloned from Steven Frank's <a href="https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt">Cloud To Butt</a>, with his permission. Thanks for helping me do something even stupider!
